This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for hate speech classification. It demonstrates how to preprocess text data, extract features, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. The project aims to classify text data into hate speech or non-hate speech categories, providing an effective solution for tackling harmful content online.

## Project Overview

Hate speech detection is an essential task for moderating online content and ensuring safer communication platforms. This project focuses on building a scalable, modular, and reproducible pipeline to classify text data using modern NLP techniques and machine learning models.

### Key Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw text data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Implementing techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings for text vectorization.
- **Model Training**: Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.
- **Scalable Pipeline**: Modular code structure for easy integration and reproducibility.

## Applications

This project is applicable in various domains, including:

- **Social Media Moderation**: Identifying and flagging harmful or abusive content.
- **Content Filtering**: Ensuring safer communication platforms by detecting hate speech.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Expanding into broader sentiment analysis tasks beyond hate speech detection.
